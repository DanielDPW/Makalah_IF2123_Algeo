## About The Project

This project explores the usage of linear algebra principles in solving Ordinary Differential Equation. By leveraging techniques such as eigenvalue decomposition and matrix diagonalization, the project aims to provide a systematic solutions for higher-order ODEs. As the project focuses on linear algebra, more complex forms of differential equations, such as non-linear or partial differential equations, are not considered. The core principles transform the ODEs into matrix form and solving them using linear algebra tools to obtain solutions. This approach highlights the power of linear algebra in simplifying and solving linear ODEs, providing a systematic approach to solving these problems.
